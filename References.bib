  abstract = {The assessment of periodic changes in water quality and uniform control standards application has been difficult to attain. A potential solution to this problem is the utilization of water quality indices for preliminary screening of data and identification of geographic areas, chronological periods, and possible source and cause of water quality changes. The purpose of this investigation was to demonstrate a practical use and application of a water quality index in Nevada as an existing option for those who must assess water quality changes on a continual basis. The study examined water quality trends in portions of the Colorado, Humboldt, Snake, Walker, and Carson River Basins, Nevada, through application of an existing water quality index to historical data from control point and adjacent monitoring stations. Index ratings were responsive in characterizing changes in water quality status relative to seasonal trends and geographic location. Identification of average annual and single value control criteria violation in terms of which parameter and degree of violation was facilitated through index application. Frequency and magnitude of impact on overall water quality status was also identified. Future use of indices in this manner should prove a valuable tool in meeting legislative water quality management strategies.}
