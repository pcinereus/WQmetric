\section{Data sources}\label{sec:sources}

Report cards are typically compiled and communicated annually.  However, the time window that
constitutes a year differs from report card to report card.  Many environmental report cards
communicate on data collected within a financial year.  This schedule provides a reporting window
that is consistent with other management and governmental considerations.  Others use a time window
that naturally aligns with the cycle of some major underlying environmental gradient - such as
wet/dry season. For this project, we are adopting using the same water year (1st Oct -- 30 Sept)
definition as the AIMS inshore Water Quality Marine Monitoring Program \citep{Lonborg-MMP-2015}.

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBR), spans nearly 14$^\circ$ of latitude, covers approximately
344,400km$^2$ and in so doing spans multiple jurisdictions with differing pressures and management strategies.
Furthermore, the GBR also spans a substantial longitudinal range being bounded by the Queesland coastline in the west and the outer reef in the east.
Hence, it is useful to partition
the GBR into smaller more homogeneous zones representing combinations of region and water body.
For this project, we will adopt
six regions (Cape York, Wet Tropics, Dry Tropics, Mackay Whitsunday, Fitzroy and Burnett Mary) and
four water bodies (Enclosed Coastal, Open Coastal, Midshelf and Offshore), see Figure \ref{fig:Map_region_waterbody}.
Following the recomendations of the Idependent Science Panel (ISP), the Enclosed Coastal zone will be
excluded from the majority of high level summary products.  Nevertheless, it will be present in exploratory
data analysis products for the sake of transparency as well as to provide some form of validation and
justification for ISP's recommendations.

\subsection{Indicators}

One of the biggest challenges of report card development is the selection of appropriate indicators
from amongst a potentially very large candidate pool.  Since the outcomes, conclusions and
implications are all dependent on the indicators selected, the selection process is one of the most
influential steps and has justifiably received a great deal of attention.

As part of their ecosystem report card framework, \citet{Harwell-1999} urged that the alignment of
scientific information with societal goals and objectives should be the guiding principle of
indicator selection.  In their framework, clearly articulated societal goals and objectives (a
combination of societal values and scientific knowledge, such as restored and sustainable wetland
system) are translated into Essential Ecosystem Characteristics (EECs) that represent a set of
generic attributes that further refine the broad goals (such as water quality, sediment quality,
habitat quality, ecological processes).  The EEC's are then further translated into a set of
scientific informed indicators that are measured or monitored to indicate the status of trends or
states associated with the EEC's.
  
There have since been numerous studies that have focused on providing more formal, objective
criterion for indicator selection \citep{Dauvin-2008, Emerson-2012, Flint-2012, James-2012}.  Whilst
the specifics vary, most can be broadly encapsulated by a \citet{Dauvin-2008}'s contextual
implementation of the \citet{Doran-1981}'s SMART (Simple, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and
Time limited) principle.  A 'good' indicator should be representative, easily interpreted, broadly
comparable, sensitive to change and have a reference or guideline value.  To be `useful', an
indicator must be approved by international consensus, be well grounded and documented, have a
reasonable cost/benefit ratio and have adequate historical and on-going spatial-temporal coverage.
\citet{Flint-2012} and \citet{James-2012} further developed numerical scoring systems to help
evaluate indicators objectively.  Nevertheless, \citep{Neary-2012} warned against the potential to
manipulate an index by saturating with inappropriate or biased indicators and whilst recommending
that an index comprise of at least seven indicators, they did advocate that the type of indicator is
more important than the number of indicators._

Since final outcomes are likely to be highly influenced by indicator choice, the robustness and
sensitivity of both indicators and final outcomes to changes in ecosystem health should be
understood if not formally investigated as part of the indicator selection process
\citep{Dobbie-2013}.  Sensitivity analyses can involve:

\begin{itemize}
\item simulating changes in the underlying data of different magnitudes and estimating the resulting
sensitivity (percentage or probability of change) expressed by the indicator
\item estimating the effect of past perturbations on the indicator hindcasted from on historical
data
\end{itemize}

As stressed above, indicators should align intimately with report card objectives.  Yet in the more
broad ecosystem report card frameworks, such indicators are often too general to be measurable.
Therefore, in such cases, the indicators are further sub-divided into progressively more specific
measures.  For example, an indicator of water quality might comprise sub-indicators of nutrients,
metals and physico-chemistry which in turn might be represented by more specific measures such as
total nitrogen, mercury, dissolved oxygen, pH etc.

The resulting design is a hierarchical structure in which sub-indicators (etc) are nested within
indicators and spatial scales are nested from entire regions, sub-regions or zones down to
individual sites or sampling units.  One of the strengths of such a hierarchical report card
framework is that the inherent inbuilt redundancy allows for the addition, deletion or exchange of
finer scale items (sites and actual measured variables) with minimum disruption to the actual report
indicators.  That is, the indicator is relatively robust to some degree of internal makeup.
Furthermore, by abstracting away the fine details of an indicator, similar indicators from different
report cards (each potentially comprising different sampling designs) are more directly comparable.
For example, in different report cards that include water quality, a water quality indicator of
'water clarity' might comprise different Measures (e.g. suspended solids, NTU, Secchi depth etc)
collected from different sources (e.g. satellite, in situ loggers or hand samples), yet provided
each of these water clarity indicators are well calibrated, it should be possible to compare state
and trend across the report cards.

\subsection{AIMS insitu samples}

The AIMS component of MMP inshore water quality monitoring sampling program has been designed to
quantify spatial and temporal patterns in inshore water quality, particularly in the context of
catchment loads.  Details of the sampling design are outlined in \citep{Lonborg-MMP-2015}.  From
2006--2014, AIMS visited 20 sites, three times per year (roughly corresponding to wet, early and
late dry seasons), see Figures~\ref{fig:AIMS_insitu_map} and \ref{fig:AIMS_insitu_spatial_temporal}.
The sites were largely selected along approximate north-south transects proximal to major rivers so
as to provide samples along an expected water quality gradients (exposure to runoff).  Following a
review in 2014, the design was modified to intensify the spatial (32 sites) and temporal (typically
between 5 and 10 samples per year) coverage of the sampling program.  In particular, additional
sampling effort was applied around three priority focal areas (Russell-Mulgrave, Tully and
Burdekin).

\subsection{Remote sensing (BOM satellite)}

Daily (July 2002--Dec 2016, $1\times 1 km^2$ resolution) Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS satellite) imagery (hereafter referred to as Satellite) data were obtained
by downloading NETCDF files from the thredds server (http://ereeftds.bom.gov.au/ereefs/tds/catalog/ereef/mwq/P1D/2002/catalog.html).
The data referred to herein relates to the individual measures considered in the data exploration
component of the project, and is distinct from the surface reflectance data used in the eReefs data
assimilation scheme discussed below in section \ref{sec:eReefs}.

\input{tables/satellite.measures.tex}

 

%\subsection{eReefs assimilated model}

\input{WQ_GBRreanalysis}

% **Mark to provide a brief description**.

In this context, the \textbf{eReefs} model refers to the
gbr4\_bgc\_?? model (see Table\ref{tab:ereefsModels} for the catalog and model descriptions and
Table\ref{tab:ereefs.measures} for a description of the variables and processing).

This source of data only extends back to 2014. Whilst the eReefs GBR4\_BGC\_? model technically does
contain 2013 calendar year data, the current project partitions time into water years in which the
full 2013 water year starts in October 2012.  Therefore as the 2013 is not a complete 12 months of
data, it is excluded from analyses. Unfortunately, this means that any signals associated with the
2010-2011 floods are unavailable.
 
\input{tables/ereefs.measures.tex}    
      

\subsection{eReefs926}

In this context, the \textbf{eReefs926} model refers to the
gbr4\_bgc\_926 model (see Table\ref{tab:ereefsModels}. This model provides alternative formulation
and importantly does extend back to the full 2013 water year thereby providing some coverage closer
to the 2010-2011 flood period.

Variables used as per Table~\ref{tab:ereefs.measures}

\subsection{Thresholds}

An environmental health metric represents the state or condition relative to some reference,
threshold or expectation.  Most of the current water quality indices compare values to a set of
specifically selected \textit{guidelines}.  These guidelines are either formulated specifically from
long-term historical data appropriate to the spatial and temporal domain of interest or else are
based on ANZEC guidelines \citep{ANZEC-2000}.
 
Typically there are strict guidelines on how these guidelines should be applied.  In particular, the
guidelines associated with various measures used in various report cards throughout the Great
Barrier Reef should be applied to annually aggregated data - not individual observations.  Since
this project intends to generate indices on the scale of individual observations, we have decided to
refer to the guidelines as \textit{thresholds} so as to avoid contradicting the terms of use of
guidelines..
 
The thresholds used for each Measure within each Region and Water body are indicated in
Table~\ref{tab:thresholds} (page~\pageref{tab:thresholds}).  Note, that whilst the application of
seasonal thresholds could potentially remove some uncertainty, in the absence of clear consensus on
how to define wet and dry seasons and what the associated set of thresholds would be, seasonal
thresholds are not used in this project.
