Exploratory data analysis is vital for informing data processing and analysis as well as
establishing assumptions and limitations.  Of particular importance for the current project is the
spatial and temporal distribution and variability of the various data Measures and Sources.  As
such, a series of exploratory plots have been generated (see Appendix~\ref{appsec:EDA} begging on
page \pageref{appsec:EDA}).  In the interest of keeping the main text free of copious graphics, we
have elected to present only a small fraction of the exploratory data analyses figures here.  The
figures presented will act as exemplars of general format and predominant features or patterns.

\subsection{All data}

Figures~\ref{fig:violin_chl_oc} -- \ref{fig:violin_NOx_oc} display the temporal distribution of
Chlorophyll-a, TSS, Secchi depth and NOx observations for the Wet Tropics Open Coastal Zone from
AIMS insitu, AIMS FLNTU, Satellite, eReefs and eReefs926 sources. All combinations of
Measure/Zone/Source can be found in
Figures~\ref{appfig:AIMS_insitu_violin_chl}--\ref{appfig:eReefs926_violin_NOx}.

All of the figures are presented with log-transformed y-axes as the data are typically skewed to the
right.  This is expected for parameters that have a natural minimum (zero), yet no theoretical
maximum.  It does however mean that these distributional properties should be considered during the
analyses.  In particular, for mean based aggregations, outliers and skewed distributions can impart
unrepresentative influence on outcomes.

Each of the data sources presents different variability characteristics.  The scale of the range of
AIMS insitu data is predominantly and approximately less than or equal to the scale of the
half/twice the associated threshold value (Fig.~\ref{fig:violin_chl_oc}a).  The AIMS FLNTU logger
data (Fig.~\ref{fig:violin_chl_oc}b) have a larger range than the AIMS insitu data - presumably
because the former data collection frequency captures most of the peaks and trophs whereas the later
is unlikely to do so.  Similarly, the scale of the range eReefs and eReefs926 data
(Fig.~\ref{fig:violin_chl_oc}d-e) is approximately equal to the scale of the range of the span from
half/twice the threshold value.  This reflects both a more complete time series and broader spatial
extent represented in the data.  In contrast to the AIMS insitu and to a lesser extent the AIMS
FLNTU and eReefs data, the scale of the range of the Satellite is relatively large - typically a
greater span than the range of half/twice threshold value (Fig.~\ref{fig:violin_chl_oc}c).

The Satellite, eReefs and eReefs926 data series all start and end part of the way through a water
year.  For annually aggregated data, this is likely to result in unrepresentative estimates and thus
only full water years will be analysed.

\subsection{Monthly data}

Figures~\ref{fig:violin_month_chl_oc_1} -- \ref{fig:violin_month_NOx_oc_1} provide finer temporal
resolution by displaying the temporal distribution of Chlorophyll-a, TSS, Secchi depth and NOx
observations for the each month within Wet Tropics Open Coastal Zone from AIMS insitu, AIMS FLNTU,
Satellite, eReefs and eReefs926 sources. Additional combinations of Measure/Zone/Source can be found
in Figures~\ref{appfig:monthly_AIMS_insitu_violin_chl}--\ref{appfig:monthly_eReefs926_violin_NOx}.

The monthly violin plots do not add any additional insights with respect to understanding the
characteristics of the underlying data to help guide the selection of appropriate indexation
formulation or perhaps even Measure/Source selection. Rather, they provide a less compacted view of
the underlying data from which patterns highlighted in Section~\ref{sec:annualchunks} might be more
easily appreciated.

\subsection{Spatial data}

Figures~\ref{fig:eda.spatial_chl_oc} -- \ref{fig:eda.spatial_NOx_m} explore the spatio-temporal
patterns in observed data from a finer spatial perspective (focussing on just the Wet Tropics Open
Coastal and Dry Tropics Midshelf Zones).  These figures highlight the disparity in resolution
between the different data sources. The AIMS insitu data is spatially very sparse \footnote{the AIMS
FLNTU logger data is even more sparse and thus is not shown.}.  The Satellite data has the most
extensive spatial resolution and notwithstanding the many gaps due to various optical interferences
(such as cloud cover), also has the greatest temporal coverage.

For the selected Zones and span of water years, there is little evidence of a major latitudinal
gradient in Satellite Chlorophyll-a with most of any change (if any) occurring across the shelf.
Indeed, Satellite parameters are relatively constant over space and time for the Dry Tropics
Midshelf Zone (see Figs.~\ref{fig:eda.spatial_chl_m}--\ref{fig:eda.spatial_sd_m}b).  Moreover, the
spatial patterns of Satellite derived Chlorophyll-a and TSS appear relatively invariant between
years (see Figs.\ref{fig:eda.spatial_chl_oc}--\ref{fig:eda.spatial_sd_m}b).

The eReefs and eReefs926 do show some variability in spatial and temporal Chlorophyll-a and Secchi
depth (see
Figs.~\ref{fig:eda.spatial_chl_oc}c-d,\ref{fig:eda.spatial_sd_oc}c-d,\ref{fig:eda.spatial_chl_m}c-d
and \ref{fig:eda.spatial_sd_m}c-d), yet relatively little for TSS and NOx (at least for Dry Tropics
Midshelf).

\subsection{Comparison of data sources}

Ensuring that the data underpinning the metric calculation is fit-for-purpose is a critical part of
the process, especially if multiple data sources for a specific indicator are to be aggregated as
part of this calculation.  For example, successful aggregation of Chlorophyll-a as modelled by the
eReefs BGC with Chlorophyll-a as extracted from satellite reflectance data (optical properties) will
largely depend on the underlying compatibility of these two sources.  Moreover, further combining
with far more sparse and irregular sources (such as AIMS insitu Chlorophyll-a samples) relies on
general patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation being present across the more dense data
sources so as to facilitate a contagious projection of sparse data across the denser layers.


The project’s recommendation is not to aggregate, for each indicator, independent streams of data.
Instead the preferred approach is to assimilate satellite reflectance information into the eReefs
BGC model and to rely on in situ measurements for verification of the model performance.

It is worthwhile noting that there is no single point of truth as the sparse in situ sampling does
not account for the dynamic nature of the receiving environment, both temporally and spatially.  It
is however possible to compare different measurement methods at a high level.


These five different sources (Satellite, eReefs, eReefs926, AIMS Insitu and AIMS FLNTU loggers) were
all collected at different spatio-temporal resolutions.  Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
\item the Satellite data are collected on a 1km grid on a daily basis, however there are many gaps
in the time series of each cell due to cloud cover and other issues that affect the reliability of
observations.
\item the eReefs data are collected on a 4km grid on a daily basis without any time series gaps
between 2013 and 2016
\item the eReefs926 data are collected on a 4km grid on a daily basis without any time series gaps
between 2011 and 2014
\item the AIMS Insitu samples are collected from specific sampling sites (28-32 throughout the GBR)
and on an infrequent basis (approx. 3-4 times per year although more frequently in later years).
Furthermore, with the exception of relatively recently, the majority of samples were collected in
the dry season and thus these samples could be biased towards long term water quality trends rather
than short-term pulses.
\item the AIMS FLNTU logger data are deployed at a subset (16) of the AIMS Insitu sampling locations
and record measurements every 10 minutes (although there are frequent gaps due to instrument
failure).
\end{itemize}

The AIMS Insitu sampling locations are strategically positioned so as to generally represent
transects away from major rivers discharging into the GBR.  As such, they likely represent biased
estimates of the water parameters of the surrounding water bodies.  Nevertheless, the observed data
are direct measurements of a range of parameters considered to be important measures of water
quality and are therefore considered to be relatively accurate estimates of the true state - albiet
for a potentially narrow spati-temporal window.  By contrast, the Satellite data represent indirect
proxies for some of these parameters (Chlorophyll-a, Total Suspended Solids and Secchi Depth) and
similarly, the eReefs data are indirect modelled estimates simulated from a deterministic
manifestation of a conceptual model.  Hence, to gauge the accuracy of the Satellite and eReefs data
(and thus inform qualitative confidence), time series and spatial patterns in the Satellite and
eReefs observations were compared to the AIMS Insitu observations.
 
The disparate spatio-temporal resolutions of the data sources present substantial challenges for
extracting comparable data.  For example, the proximity of AIMS Insitu samples to reefs and the
spatial resolution (1km or 4km grid) frequently results in an inability to obtain matching spatial
location for all three sources.  Furthermore, gaps in the Satellite time series frequently prevent
matching Satellite data to the same day as AIMS Insitu sampling.

The degree to which the discrete AIMS Insitu samples reflect space and time around the actual
sampling sites/times is largely unknown.  That is, we don't know how broadly representative the
direct observations are.  Consequently, it is difficult to estimate how broadly to filter the
Satellite and eReefs data in space and time around the AIMS Insitu sampling events in order to
generate comparable data.  The 'best' breadth is likely to be a compromise between data availability
(time limited for Satellite and space limited for eReefs)

Figures \ref{fig:satellite_vs_niskin_locations_5km} and \ref{fig:eReefs_vs_niskin_locations_5km}
illustrate the spatial distribution of Satellite and eReefs grid cell centroid locations relative to
the AIMS Insitu sampling locations.  The different color spokes denote distance categories (red:
<1km, purple: <5km) from the AIMS Insitu data.

The approach we took was to extract all observations within a specific series of spatio-temporal
windows or neighbourhoods from which we could calculate a range of association and correspondence
(such as RMSE and $R^2$) metrics (see Tables \ref{tab:association_metrics},
\ref{tab:comp.all.rmse.sum}, \ref{tab:comp.all.mae.sum} \& \ref{tab:comp.all.mape.sum}).  Tables
\ref{tab:comp.all.rmse.sum}, \ref{tab:comp.all.mae.sum} \& \ref{tab:comp.all.mape.sum} document the
top 5 ranked (according to RMSE, MAE and MAPE respectively) spatio-temporal lag associations between
Satellite/eReefs data and AIMS Insitu data.

\end{table}


Whilst it is well established that water quality parameters can be highly varied over time and
space, even approximate degrees of spatio-temporal autocorrelation for these parameters remains
largely unknown.  Nevertheless, We might expect that observations from different sources collected
at similar locations and at similar times should be more similar to one another than they are to
more distal observations.  Furthermore, whilst the absolute values derived from different sources
might not be exactly the same, we should expect a reasonable degree of correlation between the
sources.  Given these two positions (that observations should be autocorrelated and that different
sources should be correlated), we should expect that the degree of correlation between the different
sources for a given measure should be strongest for observation pairs closer together in space and
time.
  
Tables~\ref{tab:comp.all.rmse.sum.max} -- \ref{tab:comp.all.mpe.sum.max} tabulate the association
and correspondence metrics between the AIMS insitu samples and either the Satellite or eReefs data
for each Measure.  Irrespective of the association metric (RMSE, MAE or MAPE), closest associations
with AIMS insitu observations tend to occur at shorter spatial distances for eReefs data than
Satellite data, yet the opposite is apparent for temporal lags.  We might have expected that
associations would be strongest proximal (in both time and space) to the AIMS insitu samples and
associations to weaken in some sort of multidimentional decaying pattern with increasing separation.
Such a pattern would permit relatively straight forward integration of the AIMS insitu observational
data into the Satellite or eReefs layers\footnote{Having a robust and consistent pattern of spatial
and temporal autocorrelation would allow us to model the expected value of AIMS insitu data at
unobserved locations.}  However this is not the case and thus it is very difficult to formulate an
integration routine that does more than just update a very limited number of points in space and
time.

The other rationale for exploring the spatio-temporal associations between AIMS insitu data and
Satellite/eReefs data is to be able to determine the an optimal temporal lag and spatial distance
for making comparisons of trends.  Given that AIMS insitu data are in some respects considered the
more accurate (albeit limited in the degree to which they more broadly represent space and time
around the samples), a comparison of the general temporal trends of each source should give some
idea of the relative accuracy of the sources of indirect measurements (Satellite and eReefs).
Figures.~\ref{fig:chl_eReefs_vs_vs_Satellite_niskin_5km_natural} --
\ref{fig:NOx_eReefs_vs_vs_Satellite_niskin_5km_natural} illustrate the temporal patterns of
Chlorophyll-a, TSS, Secchi depth and NOx for each source (AIMS insitu, AIMS FLNTU, Satellite, eReefs
and eReefs926) for each of the AIMS insitu sampling locations.  The background fills of the site
titles are colored according to water body (Red: Enclosed Coastal, Green: Open Coastal, Blue:
Midshelf).

All sources of data are typically most variable at Enclosed Coastal sites and substantially less
variable at Midshelf sites.  Moreover, the alignment of trends also appears to be substantially
better at Midshore sites.  Enclosed Coastal and Open Coastal sites are closer to the coasts and in
particular, closer to major sources of discharge (as intended by the AIMS Water Quality MMP) whereby
water conditions are subject to more extreme fluctuations that result in conditions varying rapidly
in time and space.  Moreover, these sites are likely to be in shallower water or water whose depth
is relatively heterogeneous. As a result, data pooled within a 5km radius might represent a
substantially different body of water than that represented by the AIMS insitu point sources.  By
contrast, the conditions represented within a 5km radius at Midshelf sites are likely to be more
homogeneous and thereby resulting in a fairer comparison.

Notwithstanding the disparity in fairness between different water bodies as a result of how well the
various sources represent spatial and temporal envelopes, it is unlikely that either the eReefs
models or Satellite data are going to provide accurate estimates for Enclosed Coastal water bodies.
However, the accuracy for Midshelf and Offshore are likely to be sufficient.
