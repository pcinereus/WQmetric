\caption{Formulations and example response curves for a variety of indicator scoring methods that compare
observed values ($x_i$) to associated benchmark, thresholds or references values ($B_i$ and
dashed line). The Scaled Modified Amplitude Method can be viewed as three Steps: I. Initial Score
generation, II. Score capping (two alternatives are provided) and III. Scaling to the range
[0,1]. The first of the alternative capping formulations simply caps the Scores to set values (on a
$log_2$ scale), whereas the second formulation (Quantile based, where $Q1$ and $Q2$ are quantiles) allows thresholds quantiles to be used
for capping purposes.  Dotted lines represent capping boundaries.
In the Logistic Scaled Amplitude method, $T$ is a tuning parameter that controls the logistic rate (steepness at the inflection point).
For the purpose of example, the benchmark was set to 50.}\label{tab:indexMethods}\\[-1em]
