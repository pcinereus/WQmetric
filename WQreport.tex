The model simulations were developed as part of the eReefs project, a public-private collaboration
between Australia's leading operational and scientific research agencies, government, and corporate
Australia. Atmospherically-corrected MODIS products were sourced from the Integrated Marine
Observing System (IMOS) - IMOS is supported by the Australian Government through the National
Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy and the Super Science Initiative.‚Äù
