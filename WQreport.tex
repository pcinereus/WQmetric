\section{Introduction}

\section{Data sources}

Report cards are typically compiled and communicated annually.
However, the time window that constitutes a year differs from report card to report card.
Many environmental report cards communicate on data collected within a financial year.
This schedule provides a reporting window that is consistent with other management and governmental
considerations.  Others use a time window that naturally aligns with the cycle of some major underlying environmental
gradient - such as wet/dry season. For this project, we are adopting using the same water year (1st Oct -- 31 Sept) definition as the AIMS inshore Water
Quality Marine Monitoring Program \citep{Lonborg-MMP-2015}.
